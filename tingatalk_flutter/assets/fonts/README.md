# Fonts Directory

This directory should contain the following font files:

## Inter Font Family
- Inter-Regular.ttf (weight: 400)
- Inter-Medium.ttf (weight: 500)
- Inter-SemiBold.ttf (weight: 600)
- Inter-Bold.ttf (weight: 700)

## SF Pro Text Font Family
- SFProText-Regular.ttf (weight: 400)
- SFProText-Medium.ttf (weight: 500)

You can download these fonts from:
- Inter: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter
- SF Pro Text: https://developer.apple.com/fonts/

For now, the app will fallback to system fonts if these files are not present.
